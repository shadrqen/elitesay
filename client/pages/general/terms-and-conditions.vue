              How does it work?
            </b>
          </p>

          <p>
            This Site is an online platform where users (the “Customers”) can find freelance content writers (the
            “Writers”) who can provide high quality content writing services. As a platform, We ensure delivery of the
            services by Writers and payment to Writers by Customers. On this Site, Customers can find Writers with the
            skills required for their particular order, meeting their budget, Turn Around Time and other requirements.
          </p>

          <p>
            Writers are freelancers and are free to set up an account. Every Writer needs to pass internal tests prior
            to be able to take orders. Every Writer has its own rating. Writers with bad ratings are permanently banned
            to avoid "bad product quality" issues. If We are not sure whether certain Writer is able to render quality
            services, the Writer can be asked to provide additional data on his/her education/courses, and/or to write a
            trial piece of content in order to display his/her skills.
          </p>

          <p>
            Customers can place an order by following the order process for the required type of content to be performed
            by the Writers. Once a particular Writer accepts the order terms, it will be his/her responsibility to
            complete the order within the agreed time and ensure the quality.
          </p>

          <p>
            You also understand and agree that in course of dealing with Us you can receive certain communications from
            Us, such as service announcements, administrative messages and updates.
          </p>

          <p>
            While registering with the Site, please use a valid email address/phone number where you can be reached. We
            may be required to contact you. Providing an incorrect email address is a violation of these Terms and
            Conditions. In addition, you can use your Facebook ID to register with the Site.
          </p>

          <p>
            Customers place orders on the Site. We do not collect any fee for placing orders. Writers bid for the orders
            placed by the Customers.
          </p>

          <p>
            A Writer specializing in a field chosen by the Customer, when the order is assigned to him/her, contacts the
            Customer. The Customer may either communicate with the Writer via messaging system or request to chat with
            the Writer via Our platform at a specified time. The writer is responsible for obtaining the details of the
            order. Once a Writer's bid is accepted, the Customer deposits the agreed amount of money with Our Site.
          </p>

          <p>
            Our support team and also the Writers use a message system for communication. Writers can contact the
            customers and Our support team using the messaging system. Please check the messages regularly, and promptly
            address any questions, concerns or additional instructions using this interactive feature. You are not
            allowed to disclose personal information to Writers and ask them to work directly with you bypassing the
            Site.
          </p>

          <p>
            Both Customer and Writer can use the tracking system to know the status of the order and percentage of
            completion.
