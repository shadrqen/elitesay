## EssaySpring
<h4><b> EssaySpring </b> is a freelance academic writing platform that has been on development for quite a while - albeit under private repos.
However, I am currently in the process of moving a majority of the functionalities to be open-source. While I believe the idea and its implementation could be of high
 value to me, I feel like it would even be more should we join hands together as a community. The project has been running under a beta
release for quite some time now. There are still areas of improvement, and your contribution is highly welcome and appreciated as we make the 
world a better place - one open-source contribution at a time.</h4>

## Structure
> Customer here is used to refer to persons who post jobs in the platform, while writers are the professionals who offer their services for a fee.

The platform is decoupled into six smaller microservices that operate independently. First, it is broken down into two sub-systems, each of which has its own micro-services.
